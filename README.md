this is my first ever project to uploud on github
on this project i will analyize a book store with fake dataset that i created on python (using random seed) 
first i will create the dataset 
second i will do EDA and some cleaning if necessary(remember this is a fake_generated dataset not much of a data cleaning will be needed)
after that i will do some casual analysis before going for the ain plate "RFM"
I hope this project will be helpfull that you lern a lot from it wish you luck on your learning journey
